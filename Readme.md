I have found this taks to be very enjoyable for the most part. I struggled with using the API to fetch, so I did not include this in my code and I unfortunately repeated myself in the upgrades because I was not able to create 1 code that does everything. Please see below for the function of the game.

This is a basic cookie clicker game which works by:

- Increasing the cookies with every click.
- Buying an upgrade for 50 cookies which increases the click power to 2 cookies everytime you click (previously 1).
- Purchasing an autoclicker for 100 cookies allows the game to continue adding 1 cookie per second without clicking.
- The game is saved in the local host to allow the user to continue their progress.
- If a user tries to purchase an upgrade or autoclicker without the required amount of cookies and alert pops up.
- It also has a reset button to clear the display and local host so that the game can start again.
- It contains sound effects for both successfull and unsuccessfull purchases (with the altert).
